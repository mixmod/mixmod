\section{General purpose}
%=========================
%=========================


The general purpose of the package is to discover, or explain, group
structures in multivariate data sets with unknown (cluster
analysis or clustering) or known class (discriminant analysis or classification). It is an exploratory
data analysis tool for solving clustering and classification
problems. But it can also be regarded as a semi-parametric tool to
estimate densities with Gaussian mixture distributions and multinomial distributions.

Mathematically, mixture probability density function (pdf) $f$ is a
weighted sum of $K$ components densities

%In the gaussian case, it can be written as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%   f({\bf x}_i | \mu, \Sigma) = \sum_{k=1}^K p_k\phi({\bf x}_{i}| \mu_{k},\Sigma_{k})
%\label{mixpdf}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\phi(.| \mu_k,\Sigma_k)$ represents the density of a Gaussian
%distribution with mean $\mu_{k}$ and variance matrix
%$\Sigma_{k}$. The parameters are the mixing proportions $p_k$ ($>0$, for
%$k=1,...,K$ and $\sum_{k=1}^K p_k=1$), the means $\mu_{k}$ and the variance matrices
%$\Sigma_{k}$ of the component distribution.

%And in the qualitative case
\begin{eqnarray}
  f({\bf x}_i|\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^{K}p_kh({\bf x}_i|\lambda_k)
 \label{mixpdf}
\end{eqnarray}
where $h(.|{\lambda}_k)$ denotes a $d$-dimensional distribution parametrized by $\lambda_k$.
The parameters are the mixing proportions $p_k$ and the component of the distribution $\lambda_k$.\\

In the Gaussian case, $h$ is the density of a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu_k$
and variance matrix $\Sigma_k$, and thus $\lambda_k = (\mu_k,\Sigma_k)$.

In the qualitative case, $h$ is a multinomial distribution and $\lambda_k=(a_k,\epsilon_k)$ is the
parameter of the distribution (see statistical documentation).

\section{What is {\sc mixmod} ?}
%================================
%================================
%{\sc mixmod} software is a tool for fitting a mixture
%model (see equation \ref{mixpdf}) of multivariate gaussian or multinomial components to a
%given data set with either a clustering, a density estimation or a
%discriminant analysis point of view.\\

The name {\sc mixmod} stands for {\sc mix}ture {\sc mod}elling. Estimation
of the mixture parameters is performed either through maximum
likelihood via the EM ({\em Expectation Maximization}, Dempster et
al. 1977), the SEM ({\em Stochastic EM}, Celeux and Diebolt 1985)
algorithm or through classification maximum likelihood via the CEM
algorithm ({\em Clustering EM }, Celeux and Govaert 1992). These three
algorithms can be chained to obtain original fitting strategies
(e.g. CEM then EM with results of CEM) to use advantages of each of
them in the estimation process. As mixture problems usually have
multiple relative maxima, the program will produce different results,
depending on the initial estimates supplied by the user. If the user
does not input his own initial estimates, some initial estimates
procedures are proposed (random centers for instance).\\

It is possible to constrain some input parameters. For example, dispersions can be equal between classes, etc.\\

%In the Gaussian case,
%fourteen models of component variance matrix are implemented (obtained by
%its eigenvalue decomposition). They depend on constraints on the variance matrix such as same variance
%matrices between clusters, spherical variance matrices, etc.

In the Gaussian case, twenty-two models are implemented. Among them, fourteen models,
based on the eigenvalue decomposition, are most generally used. They depend on constraints
on the variance matrix such as same variance matrix between clusters, spherical variance matrix
\dots{} and they are suitable for data sets in any dimension.

The eight remaining gaussian models have to be used when the dimension of the data set
is high and only in a discriminant analysis situation.

In the qualitative case, five multinomial models are available. They are based on a reparametrization of
the multinomial probabilities.


In both cases, the
models and the number of clusters can be chosen by different criteria BIC
(Bayesian Information Criterion), ICL (Integrated Completed
Likelihood, a classification version of BIC), NEC (Entropy Criterion), Cross-Validation (CV) or Double Cross-Validation (DCV).\\




{\sc mixmod} is an object-oriented package built around C++ language
(it consists of a collection of C++ classes). It preserves the full
capability, performance, accuracy and low memory requirements of C,
but takes advantage of the C++ object-oriented programming
environment. This C++ version was developed jointly by Inria
Futurs (Projects IS2 and SELECT), Laboratory of Mathematics of Besan\c{c}on (UMR 6623 CNRS - Universit\'e de Franche-Comt\'e), Heudiasyc Laboratory (UMR 6599 CNRS - Universit\'e de Technologies de Compi\`egne) and Paul Painlev\'e Laboratory (UMR 8524 CNRS - Universit\'e de Lille 1).\\
{\sc mixmod} is interfaced with Scilab and Matlab; it is the easiest way to discover {\sc mixmod}.

\section{Example}
%================
%================
Modelling data with a mixture distribution is suitable when it comes from a
heterogeneous population. To illustrate this, consider the following
example. The acidity data set concerns the distribution of enzymatic
activity in the blood, for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of
carcinogenic substances, among a group of 245 unrelated
individuals. The interest here is to identify subgroups of slow or
fast metabolism as a marker of genetic polymorphism in the general
population. The purpose is to discover a group structure in the data with unknown class (cluster analysis). The number
of classes can be chosen automatically by {\sc mixmod}. In this
example {\sc mixmod} selects a two-component normal mixture. \\
The estimated parameters are given in Table~\ref{tableIntro} and Figure~\ref{figIntro} represents the histogram and the two-component mixture model obtained by {\sc mixmod}.
